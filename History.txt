  * Modified the Broker to use a special subset of the Messages. The
    intention was to have the messages received by the Broker cache their
    encoded forms and in many cases let us do zero-copy. The main traffic
    flow is from Request, ReplySuccess and ReplyFailure messages so anything
    we can do to avoid excessive copying and decoding is a performance
    win. The Broker stores the received frames and uses them for zero-copy
    forwarding whenever possible. If copies need to be made, we utilize
    the zmq_msg_copy() facility so that the buffers don't need to be copied
    from native memory to Ruby and then back again; that function let's the
    library directly reference the native memory buffer without a buffer
    copy being necessary (libzmq uses refcounting under the covers).

  * Fixed bug. When a Worker timed out in the Broker, it was deleted but
    the logic was missing to cancel its heartbeat timer and give up other
    resources. So, expired workers were still sent heartbeat messages from
    the Broker even though they were gone. To fix, the worker cleanup
    responsibility was moved from Services to Service.
    
  * Modified the READY message to include the requested heartbeat interval
    and heartbeat retries for the worker. Also, removed this same information
    from the HEARTBEAT message. This solved a problem where a Worker with
    a short heartbeat would never receive an answering heartbeat from the
    Broker before the max timeout triggered. The Broker defaulted to 180s
    between heartbeats for a new worker. The Worker would send its READY
    message and start its heartbeat timer. The heartbeat timer would fire
    but would *not* send a message because the READY message was considered
    a valid heartbeat for the current interval. By this point 2/3 of the
    max timeout had expired. By the point when the Worker sent an actual
    HEARTBEAT with its desired interval & retries, the Worker's Broker
    timeout would expire and the Worker would reconnect to the Broker and
    start all over again. Meanwhile, the Broker would *finally* get a
    HEARTBEAT, update its intervals, and then wait another interval before
    sending a message. By including the interval and retry information in
    the READY message, we avoid all of these timing issues.
    
  * Improved some logging.

  * Changed Broker to send a payload in the ClientReplyFailure message.
    Former behavior was that it just returned nil, but that's no good
    for those situations where the failure needs to specify its cause.
    So now error messages, codes and the like can be sent back as part
    of a failure message.

  * Birthday!
  
  * Client, Broker and Worker all successfully connect to each other.
  
  * Worker can successfully send READY messages. It can also send
    and receive DISCONNECT messages properly.
    
  * Broker can process READY and DISCONNECT messages from Worker.
  
  * Broker can accept REQUEST messages from Client. No processing is done other
    than responding to the request with a FAILURE_REPLY message.
    
  * Client can send REQUEST messages and receive FAILURE_REPLY messages.
  
  * Heartbeats work between worker and broker.
  
  * Consensus Broker
    * Matches client requests to the correct service and dispatches the request
      to all registered workers.
      
    * Collects worker replies and delivers aggregated results back to client.
  
    * Reply to client with FAILURE for several Consensus conditions:

      * Any worker responds with a failure.
      
      * Any worker disconnects while there is an open request.
      
      * Any worker times out while there is an open request.
      
      * When the service is already busy working on an open request.
