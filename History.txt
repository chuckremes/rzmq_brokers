  * Changed Broker to send a payload in the ClientReplyFailure message.
    Former behavior was that it just returned nil, but that's no good
    for those situations where the failure needs to specify its cause.
    So now error messages, codes and the like can be sent back as part
    of a failure message.

  * Birthday!
  
  * Client, Broker and Worker all successfully connect to each other.
  
  * Worker can successfully send READY messages. It can also send
    and receive DISCONNECT messages properly.
    
  * Broker can process READY and DISCONNECT messages from Worker.
  
  * Broker can accept REQUEST messages from Client. No processing is done other
    than responding to the request with a FAILURE_REPLY message.
    
  * Client can send REQUEST messages and receive FAILURE_REPLY messages.
  
  * Heartbeats work between worker and broker.
  
  * Consensus Broker
    * Matches client requests to the correct service and dispatches the request
      to all registered workers.
      
    * Collects worker replies and delivers aggregated results back to client.
  
    * Reply to client with FAILURE for several Consensus conditions:

      * Any worker responds with a failure.
      
      * Any worker disconnects while there is an open request.
      
      * Any worker times out while there is an open request.
      
      * When the service is already busy working on an open request.
